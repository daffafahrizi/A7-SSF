# EcoBin: Transforming the Way We Dispose

 In this modern day world, the current day-to-day waste disposal systems heavily rely on manual operation, requiring individuals to physically open the trash bin lid, whether using their hands or their feet. This process not only consumes time, but also creates inconvenience and gives a suboptimal user experience, leading to discomfort and dissatisfaction. The manual operation required to open the bin lid can be cumbersome and unhygienic. Moreover, individuals may hesitate to dispose of waste properly if they perceive the process as inconvenient or unpleasant. Therefore, there is a need for a more comfortable and user-friendly waste disposal system.
 
 
 The Eco Bin is an innovative and environmentally friendly automated trash bin system. It is powered by a HC-SR04 distance sensor and an Arduino microcontroller, enabling automation and enhances the user experience. 
 
 When a person approaches the bin, the distance sensor will detect their presence and send a signal to the Arduino. The Arduino will then activate a servo motor, automatically opening the bin lid. This automation eliminates the need for manual operation, significantly improving the efficiency and convenience of waste disposal. In addition to the automated operation, the Eco Bin will include a manual button for opening the bin lid, providing users with flexibility and efficiency in disposing trash.
